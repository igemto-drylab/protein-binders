# Protein-binders

Colab notebook for inhibitor generator code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fPjtprQPXPXoACYCFLDiV8rIjBB6soV5?usp=sharing

To generate a binder, replace the `target` in the last cell with the amino acid sequence of the protein you want to inhibit.

`dimer_train.pt` is the best performing model on the training data.
`dimer_val.pt` is the best performing model on the validation data.
